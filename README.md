<b>Lessons learned</b>
How to Graph: Most difficult part of the project is deciding what type of graphs
would best represent the data.  It required me to look to business friends or manager
who have ran a business before making sales. The next hardest thing is deciding whether
or not I wanted to have static data that I typed in or use an array to make logic functions
for each graph like searching in a database.
